These next steps provide an ideal place to start writing applications in Go to run on Kubernetes. Each step will take you from raw Go code to packaging it in a container, and then to running your contained application on Kubernetes.

You will learn how:

- Write a basic Rust application as a microservice
- Package a Rust microservice in a container
- Run a Rust microservice on Kubernetes

> [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language focused on performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, and provides memory safety without using garbage collection. -[wikipedia on Rust programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language))
